# Captain Voice Diversity - A Spore ModAPI mod
Allows civilization, space and captain creatures to retain their unique sentient voices outside of adventures, and as playable creatures. Does not currently affect Civilization or Space Stage itself.

**Requires the following to...**
### Compile
* SporeModder FX (for .package files)
* Visual Studio 2019 (for the ModAPI code itself)
* A zip file manager (for packing the .sporemod file ~by renaming a .zip file~)

### Install and play
* Spore and Galactic Adventures expansion pack, preferably from Origin or GoG
* Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit, preferably a version from after 2019

## Special thanks
* Splitwirez, Plencka (Mrs. White/Auntie Owl), emd4600, Rosalie and VanillaCold/ChocIce75 for helping out with coding the mod and overall research.
