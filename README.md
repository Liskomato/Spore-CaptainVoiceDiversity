**Requires the following to...**
### Compile
* SporeModder FX (for .package files)
* Visual Studio 2019 (for the ModAPI code itself)
* Spore ModAPI Development Kit
* A zip file manager (for packing the .sporemod file ~by renaming a .zip file~)

### Install and play
* Spore and Galactic Adventures expansion pack, preferably from Origin or GoG
* Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit, preferably a version from after 2019

## Special thanks
